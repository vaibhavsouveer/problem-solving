We have to be careful of how we are returning values from recursion function.

When writing the code try to imagine how the recursive calls are being made, how the method calls
are going into stack and what values they will have and what values they will return. Try to draw
the recursive tree diagram and see how the returned value will propagate when recursion starts to
unfold.

Keep in mind that whenever after a number of recursive calls are made and you find the answer in the
last call then you should carefully see if this answer will be say added to or multiplied or
concatenated to String literal, etc. and based on that we should see how the returned value from
recursive call is used.

Example, in case of finding floor of element (binary search) we get the answer in the last recursive
call. This answer does not need to be added to previous answers (say when we are summing array) or
concatenated (say when finding power set of string). So we can just return this answer up.

So the statement calling recursive function will be:
 return fun(arr, s, e, t, res);
