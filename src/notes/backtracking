Backtracking may be needed when the data is stored in reference.
Once the recursion unfolds, we will need the original data without modification from recursion calls down the recursive tree.
If we store data in reference, once the value is added, it needs to be removed also once the recursion unfolds.
For primitive data it is not needed as this changes for each recursion call and when recursion unfolds the value is the original one only.
