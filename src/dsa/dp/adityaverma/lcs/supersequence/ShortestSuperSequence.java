/*
Given two strings a, b. A super sequence will be a string that has both strings a and b
as a sequence it it. Example if a = abcd, b = bcxy then
one super sequence will be abcdbcxy - this is the longest one
another will be abcbcdxy and so on.
Of all the possible super sequences we have to find the shortest one.

Length of shortest supersequence will be a.len + b.len - LCS.len
Shortest super sequence is one which has all the common elements written only once.
This is essentially the LCS.
